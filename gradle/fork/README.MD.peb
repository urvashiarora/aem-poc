## Description

TBD

## Building

Project build is based on [Gradle](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/userguide.html) and using [Gradle AEM Plugin](https://github.com/Cognifide/gradle-aem-plugin).

### Environment

0. See [prerequisites](https://github.com/Cognifide/gradle-aem-plugin/tree/develop#environment-configuration)
1. Generate user-specific properties file covering AEM instance source files and configuration:
    ```bash
    sh gradlew props
    ```
2. Append project-specific host entries to OS-specific file by running script:
    * `sh hosts` (Unix)
    * `hosts.bat` (Windows)

3. Create, run and configure AEM instances and AEM dispatcher automatically by running command:
    ```bash
    sh gradlew setup
    ```

### Application

To build CRX package and deploy it on AEM instance(s), simply run command:

```bash
sh gradlew
```

# AEM Demonstrative Site

## Description

* the purpose of that module is to have a pre-configured sites structure ready for QA / client demonstration useful especially in case of agile workflows (Scrum / Kanban) to demonstrate complete features,
* could be re-installed together with application deploy (all content changes will be overridden after each deployment).
